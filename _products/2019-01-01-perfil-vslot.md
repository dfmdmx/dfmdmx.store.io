#### Perfil de aluminio 6061-T6 con ranuras para movimiento lineal y armado modular.

**V-Slot Linear Rail** is the ultimate solution combining both linear motion and a modular, structural framing system. It's lightweight yet rigid and provides an ultra smooth track for precise motion.

>â€œ V-Slot Linear Rails are precise, easy to work with and allows you unlimited design control through it's modular nature."

Much like working with lumber, you can cut V-Slot on a chop saw (using a metal blade) or even use a hacksaw. From there, you simply use a screw driver to make the connections.
