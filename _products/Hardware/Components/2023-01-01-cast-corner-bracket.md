### Information

Description:
 These Cast Corner Brackets are used to connect two V-Slot Linear Rails together for a 90 degree connection. "Mount this corner to V-Slot Linear Rail using M5x8mm Low Profile Screws and M5 Tee Nuts." Product Details  Qty. 1 Dimensions: 20mm x 20mm x 17mm 4mm Wide T-Slot Tab Compatible with 20mm V-Slot Linear Rail Cast Aluminum Color: Silver  Pro-Tip: The Cast Corner Brackets have stand off teeth (great for locking into the slot).  When mounted in this direction you would utilize an M8 Low Profile Screw and an M5 Tee Nut.  If you need to use the Cast Corners perpendicular to the V-Slot Linear Rail you can either flip the M5 Tee Nut upside down in the track of the V-Slot Linear Rail (this will ensure that the screw will grab the threads of the M5 Tee Nut) or you can sand the tabs off the bottom of the Corner Connector.
