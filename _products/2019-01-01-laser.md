### Pick your Laser Wattage:
There are 4 wattage levels to choose from (2.8W, 4.2W or 7W+).  Most customers go with the 2.8W, 4.2W or the 7W.  The lower power has a lower price, but will take longer to do the same burn level in an engraving.  The 4.2W will go 2x as fast and the 7W will go 4x as fast for the same burn level as the 2.8W.  The 2.8W has a bit finer detail, but you can also get the high resolution lens option for the 4.2W and the 7W lasers.

### High Resolution AR Coated Lens
This lens will create a smaller and more “rounded” beam to the laser giving a higher resolution spot.  While this is not as noticeable on the smaller wattage lasers, it can be a significant improvement for >2.8W lasers when engraving and cutting.

### The standard kit comes with:

  - Laser diode component with mounting screws
  - Laser Shroud or Magnet Base Plate
