### Pre-built business workshops
Small scale and local manufacturing workshop's based on the Production Cloud Server with the goal of re-dignifying Mexico's low income housing through digital parametric designed and automated industrial manufactured ~~furniture~~.

### About
Mexico has long lost the ability to self maintain itself through localized production knowledge....

## Materials and services
#### Materials:
The list of materials should be as short as possible, they all need to be panel shaped and stored on site.
  * Laminated plywood (Solid colors only)
  * Composite aluminum (Solid colors only)
  * Aluminum 6061 (Natural or sanded)
  * Lexan
  * High density industrial plastics

#### Storefront services:
The services must be performed on site.
  * Live adjustment of parametric products and rendering
  * 2D CAD/CAM g-code file creation
  * CNC machining
  * Semi-automatic PVC edge banding for laminated plywood

#### Web services:
Online store interactions.
  * Requests simple machining job and upload drawing files (hosted in the cloud server)
  * Online parametric store for initial products (external web-app for e-commerce)

## Initial products
The first approach will be to start with some of the most utilitarian home furniture. It should be designed only with the materials and production methods provided by the workshop. All of these initial product will be delivered as parametric files ready to be lived adjusted for the client and ready to send from the Sales department directly into Manufacturing.

#### Product list:
  * Closet
  * Bathroom/Kitchen sink cabinet
  * Bathroom/Kitchen cabinets
  * Working desk/table
  * Door internal
  * Door external
  * Panel wall - Exterior
  * Lightweight self standing wall - Interior
  * Table (not parametric)
  * Chair (not parametric)

## Machines
#### Machines needed:
  * 1 - CNC machine 250cm x 130cm  - Work machine  
  * 1 - CNC Machine 90cm x 90cm - Desktop machine
  * 1 - CNC mono axis machine for edge drilling
  * 1 - 3D printer
  * 1 - Semi-automatic edge banding machine
  * 1 - Sanding machine +- 450cm cube
  * n - ...

## Product workflow
The workflow divided into manageable segments:

  * **Sales**  
  Creates the initial product in the cloud with the design request.

  * **Drawing**  
  Sees the request from the sales team and returns the product ready for manufacturing including cutting time, processes involved and materials needed.

  * **Cutting**  
  This team is the one in charge of machining the g-codes created by the drawing team and preparing the manufactured parts for the next team.

  * **Edge banding**  
  This process is only used for some laminated plywood projects.

  * **Packaging**  
  Involves protecting the work done for further integration or shipping.  

  * **Assembly**  
  If necessary this team is the one in charge of Assembly and Installation. Assembly depends on Sales.

Sales and Assembly does not properly belongs to this workflow and its coordinated by a separate department.

## Internal structure

### Management
The management team will be the same for all workshops and sales teams. They will all be integrated through the production cloud server.

#### Tasks:
  * Accounting
  * Internal task management
  * Retail purchases and stock control
  * IT

#### Job titles:
  * Director (Senior)
  * Accountant (Senior or outsourced)
  * Auxiliary Accountant (Junior)

### Sales
Involves sales outside the storefront services and works alongside the workshop team. Its was originally thought as a separate side department and still open for debate.

#### Tasks:
  * Sales
  * Shipping
  * Assembly and Installation (if needed will be provided by an external team)
  * Client service

#### Job titles:
  * Salesperson (Senior)

### Workshop
This team is the backbone of the manufacturing process.

#### Tasks:
  * Storefront services
  * Drawing
  * Cutting
  * Edge banding
  * Packaging

#### Job titles:
  * Workshop manager (Senior)
  * Designer or similar (Junior)
  * CNC operator (Junior)
  * Manufacturing Auxiliary (Junior)

## Workspace

## Responsibility
We need to understand that making this project community based is not enough to justify the materials involved in the production process. *There is no point in dignifying low income housing if Earth is inhabitable.* This project cannot be understood without a future phase in which the materials used are also self manufactured. This will allow for the waste product of the machines to be recycled.

We still need to further plan this strategy but its main goal is to **#MakePeaceWithBillNye**.
