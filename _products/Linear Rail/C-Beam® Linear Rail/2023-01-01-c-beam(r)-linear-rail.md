### Information

Description:
 

  C-Beam® Linear Rail

  C-Beam Linear Rail aluminum extrusion profile is the ultimate solution combining both linear motion and a modular, structural framing system. It\'s lightweight yet rigid and provides an ultra smooth track for precise motion.

OpenBuilds created C-Beam Linear Rail aluminum extrusion profile and has added a library of compatible modular Parts which today is known as the OpenBuilds System.  We have shipped over a million feet of V-Slot/C-Beam and counting to businesses, classrooms, laboratories and makers all over the world!

Much like working with lumber, you can cut C-Beam on a chop saw (using a metal blade) or even use a hacksaw. From there, you simply use a screw driver to make the connections. #OpenBuilds #C-Beam #V-Slot #Vslot #OpenBuildsSystem

  “ C-Beam Linear Rails are precise, easy to work with and allows you unlimited design control through it\'s modular nature."
