### Information

Description:
 

  V-Slot® Linear Rail

  V-Slot Linear Rail aluminum extrusion profile is the ultimate solution combining both linear motion and a modular, structural framing system. It\'s lightweight yet rigid and provides an ultra smooth track for precise motion.

OpenBuilds created V-Slot Linear Rail aluminum extrusion profile and has added a library of compatible modular parts which today is known as the OpenBuilds System. We have shipped over one million feet of V-Slot and counting to businesses, classrooms, laboratories and makers all over the world!

Much like working with lumber, you can cut V-Slot on a chop saw (using a metal blade) or even use a hacksaw. From there, you simply use a screw driver to make the connections. #OpenBuilds #V-Slot #Vslot #OpenBuildsSystem

  “ V-Slot Linear Rails are precise, easy to work with and allows you unlimited design control through it\'s modular nature."
