Description:
 

  Cut2D Desktop is an easy to use vector drawing and editing package with powerful 2D machining strategies for CNC routing, milling or engraving.

Cut2D Desktop provides a powerful but intuitive software solution for cutting parts on a CNC router and includes tools for 2D design and editing and efficient 2D toolpath calculation. It can only output G-Code for toolpaths no greater than 24” x 24”. If you need to to create projects bigger than 24" x 24 please look into this other solutions from Vectric: VCarve Pro / Aspire

Key Strengths of Cut2D Desktop

The software can import 2D designs from other programs but also provides a full set of drawing and editing tools.

The toolpath options cover all typical 2D routing operations such as Profiling, Pocketing, Auto-Inlays and Drilling.

Each toolpath includes appropriate options to customize the settings and provide a high level of control for different types of operation.

In addition all toolpaths can be previewed to show just how the part will look when it is actually cut, this allows instant feedback so toolpaths can be further optimized.

Cut2D includes the functionality demanded for complex work while remaining incredibly easy to use and affordably priced.

Toolpath Tiling – Divides toolpaths to fit material or machine limits
